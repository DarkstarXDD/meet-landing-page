- Converted the JPG images in the middle of the page to WebP format for better performance.
- Self-hosted fonts for faster loading.

#

### Testing and Accessibility. üß™

- Used the Responsively App to check the site's appearance on various screen sizes, from 320x480 to 3000x2000.
- Set the browser font size on desktop to various values ranging from 9px to 56px to ensure everything on the site scales properly with the user's preferred browser font size.
- Zoomed the page in and out using Ctrl + Scroll wheel (up to 500%).
- Tested with the NVDA screen reader.
- Viewed the site on an iPhone 11 in both portrait and landscape modes.
- Performed Lighthouse and PageSpeed tests. ([PageSpeed Result.](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-meet-landing-page-darkstarxdd-vercel-app/xt2jb9k7it?form_factor=mobile))

### Problems Faced. üöß

- The hero image at the top was a bit tricky. On mobile layout it‚Äôs one image. But on the desktop layout it‚Äôs two separate images. To achieve that result i used two `<picture>` elements. Both picture elements have the mobile version of the image as the default image. Then, one picture element has the left desktop image as the `srcset` while the other picture element has the right desktop image as the `srcset`.

  Since mobile image is the default for both picture elements, one picture element is hidden on mobile screen using `display: none`. Only one is visible. When the screen is on desktop sizing, both picture elements will be visible and both will be switched to the image defined in their respective `srcsets`. Giving the required result. Below is a simplified version of the code.

  ```html
  <picture class="picture-left">
    <source
      media="(min-width: 80rem)"
      srcset="/assets/images/desktop/image-hero-left.png"
    />
    <img src="/assets/images/tablet/image-hero.png" />
  </picture>

  <div class="hero-content">...content</div>

  <picture class="picture-right">
    <source
      media="(min-width: 80rem)"
      srcset="/assets/images/desktop/image-hero-right.png"
    />
    <img src="/assets/images/tablet/image-hero.png" />
  </picture>
  ```

- On the design file there was an overflow effect on the hero image, i struggled a lot to achieve it, and with some help managed to get it to a working state. But in the end i ended up not using it. I liked the current solution without any overflowing effect on the image.

### Ending Notes üìù

- Nothing completely new was learned but this project gave me some good experience considering this had a fair amount of elements. Up until now most of the projects i have done were component projects or coming soon pages with a far less number of elements than this. So this was a good opportunity to apply and practice the things i have been learning so far.
- Used a negative margin to position the overlapping number 2 at the bottom.
- Used a pseudo element to get the overlay color on section 2. Initially i tried the `background-blend-mode` property but couldn't get the exact color in the design file. So went with the pseudo element which gave the result that was needed.
- There were couple of places where the color contrast wasn't passing the check, but i didn't want to change the colors in the design. As a result, couldn't hit the 100% mark on the lighthouse accessibilty test.
- Overall it was a nice project. I loved this design, loved the colors and the layout. There were some minor inconsistencies in the design file values which i think could have been avoided but it was ok. The only thing i didn't like was the hero image overflow which i spent too much time trying to make it work.
